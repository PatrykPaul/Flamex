  - **Data Cleaning**: I performed preprocessing tasks to clean the dataset from errors such as duplicate entries, incorrect data formatting, and missing values. Functions like `IFERROR`, `ISBLANK`, and `VLOOKUP` were used to identify and rectify these issues efficiently.
  - **Data Validation**: Used data validation rules to prevent incorrect data entry, ensuring consistency and reliability of the dataset.
  - **Text Functions**: Applied functions like `TRIM`, `TEXT`, and `LEFT/RIGHT` to standardize text data and remove any unwanted characters.
  - **Conditional Formatting**: Implemented conditional formatting to quickly visualize and flag any anomalies or outliers in the dataset.
  -  
- **Advanced Formulas**: Utilized a variety of advanced Excel functions to automate complex calculations, such as:
  - **`SUMIFS`** and **`COUNTIFS`** for multi-criteria data aggregation.
  - **`INDEX`** and **`MATCH`** for cross-referencing data across multiple sheets.
  - **`ARRAYFORMULA`** for more complex, multi-dimensional calculations.
  
- **Charts**: Various types of charts were created to visually represent financial data and service comparisons. These included:
  - **Bar and Column Charts**: To display the total revenue and order quantity per service.
  - **Pie Charts**: To show the percentage distribution of revenue by service.
  - **Line Charts**: Used for trend analysis and forecasting of revenue and profits over multiple years.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Insights

This project provided valuable insights into the performance and growth opportunities for FHU FLAMEX. By analyzing data for 2023, we were able to uncover key trends and identify areas for business improvement:

- **Increased Orders**: Compared to 2022, the company saw a **20% increase in orders**, indicating that demand for their services is growing steadily. This uptick was particularly noticeable in the months of June and July, when fire safety evaluations and BHP training were in high demand.
  
- **Most Profitable Service**: The **"Explosion Hazard Assessment"** service generated **43% of the total revenue**, making it the company's most profitable service. This insight suggests that focusing more on promoting and expanding this service could lead to even higher revenue in the future.

- **Revenue Growth**: The company's **total revenue** for 2023 reached **128,350 PLN**, surpassing the projected goal by 7%. This was mainly driven by the increase in higher-margin services such as fire extinguisher legalization and safety audits.

- **Service Price Competitiveness**: In comparison to competitors, FLAMEX's service prices remain highly competitive. However, certain services like **"Fire Safety Instruction"** and **"BHP Training"** were priced slightly above market average, which could be an opportunity for strategic pricing adjustments to capture a larger market share.

- **Seasonal Trends**: The data revealed clear seasonal trends in demand for services, with the highest number of orders coming during the summer months. This can inform future marketing efforts to maximize revenue during peak demand periods.

- **Customer Retention**: The analysis showed that a significant portion of orders came from repeat customers, indicating high satisfaction with services. Continuing to build customer loyalty through quality service will be crucial for sustaining growth.

- **Forecasts and Projections**: Based on historical data and trend analysis, the company is projected to see **steady revenue growth** over the next two years, with an estimated revenue of **150,000 PLN** in 2025 if the current growth trajectory continues. Profit margins are also expected to improve as operational efficiencies increase.

- **Potential for Service Expansion**: The analysis identified opportunities for expanding services such as **fire safety documentation preparation** and **fire extinguisher inspections**, which could help further diversify the company's service offerings and stabilize income across different seasons.
